## Fergus Cooper

### Research software engineer

I did my DPhil in the [Wolfson Centre for Mathematical Biology](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/groups/mathematical-biology) at the University of Oxford.

My DPhil research focussed on the development of computational tools which I applied to the understanding of biological processes in epithelial development.
Through the development of computational modelling tools I have become interested in, and an advocate for, software best practices within academia.

I am a leading developer on the [Chaste project](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/), contribute to a number of other projects including [Trase](https://github.com/trase-cpp/trase) and [PINTS](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/projects/PINTS/), and have a particular interest in the C++ programming language.
